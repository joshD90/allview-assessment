### Using The Project

There is a button 'Restrict Navigation', 'Free navigation' which has been placed at the top of the form purely for review convienence. Clicking it will determine whether the program prevents your from moving on to the next page with outstanding errors.

There is a wider range of validations to perform however in keeping with what was already on the site I have commented out the wider range to adhere to what is on the site. Please go to /src/validationSchemas/patientDetailsSchema.ts to uncomment these for full validation of the form.
